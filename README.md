GraphTheoryProject
==================
This project was done as a part of assignment the Graph Theory and Combinatorics.

Problem Statement:
A triangle-free graph is an undirected graph in which no three vertices form a triangle of
edges [1]. In order to determine a Ramsey graph based on r colourings, it often sufﬁces to
investigate maximal triangle-free graphs of any colour any colour among the r colours [2].
These are triangle-free graphs for which the insertion of any further edges would create a
triangle [3]. Develop a program that counts the number of maximal triangle free graphs
that can be constructed from n vertices, where n > 1. 






Bonus Question:

If the graph is a complete graph and if the program identiﬁes whether or not it is a Ramsey
graph based on the number of colourings r . You may assume that the value of k and l in
R(r,k,l) is 2 and 3 respectively. Thus only Ramsey graphs with R(r,2,3) = n need to be
identiﬁed.
